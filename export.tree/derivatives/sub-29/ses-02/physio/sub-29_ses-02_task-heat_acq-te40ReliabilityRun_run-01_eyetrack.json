    "Description": "Preprocessed pupil data from eye tracking. Eyeblinks automatically detected by the EyeLink software were removed, and manual corrections for additional blinks or artifacts were applied. Missing data due to blinking periods were interpolated linearly. The data were then down-sampled to 100Hz and low-pass filtered with a cut-off frequency of 4 Hz.",

    "TaskDescription": "Participants were subjected to 1-second heat pain stimuli at 48 degrees Celsius applied to one of five patches on the left inner forearm. The task aimed to investigate the reliability of one heat pain evoked BOLD responses at a TE of 40ms across two consecutive days, as well as understand the effects of different TEs on the spinal cord BOLD signal.",
