    "TaskDescription": "Participants were subjected to 1-second heat pain stimuli at 48 degrees Celsius applied to one of five patches on the left inner forearm. The task aimed to investigate the reliability of one heat pain evoked BOLD responses at a TE of 40ms across two consecutive days, as well as understand the effects of different TEs on the spinal cord BOLD signal.",
    "InstitutionName": "Max-Planck-Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences",
    "BreathingSignalDescription": "The breathing signal was used in its raw form without any preprocessing steps. It was directly incorporated into the Physiological Noise Modelling (PNM) process.",
    "ECGTracePreprocessing": "The Electrocardiogram (ECG) data were preprocessed using EEGLAB (Delorme & Makeig, 2004) and the FMRIB plug-in for EEGLAB, provided by the University of Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB), to remove MR-artifacts from the data traces recorded during functional runs (Niazy et al., 2005).",
    "RpeakDetectionAndCorrection": "On the preprocessed ECG traces, R-peaks were automatically detected using in-house Matlab scripts. Manual correction was applied as necessary to ensure accuracy of R-peak identification."
